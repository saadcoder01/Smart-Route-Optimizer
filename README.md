# Smart-Route-Optimizer
User Driven Route Optimizer

Just wrapped up a C++ project: User-Driven Route Optimizer!

Built a smart console-based app that helps users find the best route between locationsâ€”whether you're walking, biking, or driving. ðŸ§ âœ¨

âœ… Considers traffic, U-turns, distance, and road construction

âœ… Recommends the fastest & smoothest route

âœ… Built fully in C++ using OOP concepts like classes andÂ modularÂ design.
